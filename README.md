Type: QGIS · Socioeconomic Data · Visual Analytics

**Summary**:

Mapped areas at risk of transport-related social exclusion to evaluate whether proposed rail projects would improve accessibility.

**Problem**:

Decision-makers needed evidence on whether transport investments were reaching communities most in need.

**Approach**:

- Combined proposed corridor data with open TRSE datasets in QGIS.

- Classified local areas by exclusion risk.

- Produced thematic maps showing where accessibility improvements were greatest.

**Outcome**:

Informed equitable transport policy decisions and strengthened the social value case for proposed projects.
